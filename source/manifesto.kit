        Curiosity for Life, Passion for Architecture, Design, Innovation, People and Socialization are the key-elements and the engine in this “out of box” concept between raving, design, architecture, technology and people.<br><br>

        We are creative with different expertise and background: Architects, Artists, Designers, Makers, Photographers, Sociologists, Pshychologyst, Management but also Dj’s, Performers, Dancers, Barmans.<br><br>

        Our vision is not only engage people for the party but be part of a family witch who share, co-operate and exchange positive vibes, raving on the dance floor and also discuss about technology, creativity, people and emotions, trying to improve our knowledge and turn an event in an unique experience.<br><br>

        Clubs are becoming more and more hybrid and multifunctional social space, like our itinerant CREATIVE CLUB, officially an Art Performance Container.
