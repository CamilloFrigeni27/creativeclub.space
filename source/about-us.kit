        We started from a classroom in a design school in Milan where we were teaching a class which had the assignment of delivering a complete case study of a new mobile app from the ground up. In 28 nights we were able to turn that school in a Creative Club: a hybrid space for experimenting, innovating and socializing, a place where creativity, technology and cooperation are at the heart of the project.<br><br>

        USE TECHNOLOGY TO ESCAPE TECHNOLOGYâ€”Creative Club's silver thread which makes a night-out or an exhibit become a unique experience which aims to make people active elements of a space.<br><br>

        CREATIVE CLUB came to life on April 15th 2018 at 4:20 AM with the will of evolving and expanding ourselves beyond our reality to reach universes we haven't explored yet.<br><br>
