        D.L.S.B. THEORY (Darkness Light Sound BPM)<br><br>

        “One year ago, 16 April 2017, I moved from Bergamo to Amsterdam, for a new experience: work in D/DOCK a sustainable, innovative and human centered design studio.<br><br>

        I left my family, my friends, my city and my ‘normal’ routine: architecture and designer during the week, event promoter and raver during the weekend.<br><br>

        After few months in this creative and young city, and after a long time away from ‘party hard’ in Italy,  my passion for raving, events and promoting was back, but in a different way, trying to understand dutch electronic (Sub)culture, fascinated by the positive and respectful behavior of ravers (Amsterdammers) and the way to use the technology to trigger emotions.<br><br>

        I spoke with some friends, and thanks to SIPH•LAB who believed in me, I decide to go on in this ‘Out of Box’ and borderline research: <br><br>

        FIRST STEP<br>
        Research about Electronic (Sub)culture.<br><br>

        Music: merge people of different background: age, nationality, sex, religion…<br>
        (Sub)culture: group of people with a culture (electronic music) which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to, known as the "dominant" culture. In the electronic music there are different subculture, based on different BPM and the rhythmic.<br><br>

        BPM: is an Acronym for Beats Per Minute. It means, how many beats in some song appear in a minute, and it describes the “tempo of the song.”<br>

        Rules: free your mind, enjoy yourself  but  respect the other people and the vibe on the dance floor.<br>

        Creativity and Technology: experiment with darkness, lights and sound triggering people in an unique experience.<br>

        Unique Experience: creativity and technology combined with  sound and people turn a smart design in a emotional journey.<br>

        Emotional journey: disconnect your self from the daily routine, refresh your body and brain.<br><br>


        SECOND STEP<br>
        Raving with friends, during the weekend, in the darkness<br><br>

        In Amsterdam, there are many different kind hybrid space or reused, turned in club.<br><br>
        One of this clubs is located in the basement of a “Creative Hub” tower, and the mission is let experience the club not only with music and Dj’s, but link the experience with art, visual art, live performance, conference and exposition. <br><br>
        One other one, reopened from an abandoned building is a 24-hours licensed initiative: open 7 days a week as a club, a music venue, a restaurant, a cafe , a garden, a huge and cozy smoking area, a darkroom, a cinema and an exhibition space. In the basement there is an “extreme” dance floor.<br><br>

        “Design, Experience and Sound quality is continually in mind. Next to House and Techno, they are curator for the vanguard of dance music, showcasing electronica from the defining outreaches of the industry.”<br><br>

        Dutch Clubs are being  Art Performance Container, hybrid and multifunctional social space where Light, Design, Sound, Art, Performance and People are used to trigger emotion in people<br>
        Clubs can be extreme but cozy, dark but dazzling, adverse but homely.<br>
        Dutch clubs are definitely an ART PERFORMANCE CONTAINER.<br>
