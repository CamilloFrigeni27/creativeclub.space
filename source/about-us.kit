        <p class="title">SIPH • LAB</p>
        <p>A company that operates in the communication sector through new technologies.</p>
        <p>But before and even more than this, SIPH • LAB is a team of young avant-garde who try to imagine what and how the future will be, not to suffer it and try with courage and imagination to grasp all the opportunities to own it.</p>
        <p><i>"How will the future of many services on the market today be?”</i></p>
        <p>From that question began a challenge, characterized by study, research, development and testing, then still study, research and testing, to make more effective our new communication proposal, projected to the future, which looks at the willingness and ability of companies and companies, to be always competitive over time.</p>

        <p class="title">MOHOLE</p>
        <p>We dreamed of a bright but warm, deconstructed but functional, spacious but intimate space, organized but not too neat, a place to think, create, make mistakes, propose, produce, present.</p>
        <p>We dreamed of an open identity project. Where people could take care of training, production and promotion of photography, cinema, theater, fashion, comics, web, communication, animation, writing, without getting bored and alienate.</p>
        <p>We dreamed of a real company, with real employees, with real contracts, real responsibilities, real budgets.</p>
        <p>An ethical company where human capital was always at the center of everything. A human-friendly company, where every distinction, of any kind, was considered simply obsolete.</p>
        <p>We dreamed of a place to stay, where to breathe, where to grow, where to give and receive out of any rhetoric.
        We dreamed of Mohole.</p>
