      <p class="mb-5">Mohole Exposition<br>
        Creativity and student's projects play an important role in MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB. In this multi-sensorial experiment, the goal is to turn a student’s exposition in 360° experience engaging the senses of the the visitors and trying to stimulate their inner emotions.<br><br>

        [GOAL]<br>

        • The instrument is the product of ingenuity, the encounter with an external world not “ wild " but “ tamed " made on a human scale and dimensioned to its needs.<br>
        • Get out of the limits of the melody and enter the world of harmony.<br>
        • From this experimentation between wild, tamed, melody and harmony comes MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB
