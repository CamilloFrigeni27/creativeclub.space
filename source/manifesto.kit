      <p>
        Today consumers are quickly becoming dependent on a constant connection with information, entertainment and education, all only a tap away all day, every day.<br><br>

       [VISION] <br>
       [USE TECHNOLOGY TO ESCAPE TECHNOLOGY] <br>
       In the digital age, where everything is accessible and the costumer is connected everywhere, we need to focus on people and be more human centred in thinking design, understanding people on their own terms. 
       Merge  technology and design  and turn them in an emotional experience like In the  dutch electronic (sub)culture where darkness, lights,sound and BPM are used to  trigger people in an unique journey, disconnecting us from the daily routine.
       Like the Dutch Clubs which became more and more hybrid  and multifunctional social gatherings, the CREATIVE CLUB is an art performance container. <br><br>


       [MULTISENSORIAL EXPERIMENT _001] <br>
       [MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB] <br>
       Creativity and student's projects play an important role in MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB. In this multi-sensorial experiment, the goal is to turn a student’s exposition in 360° experience engaging  the senses of the the visitors and trying to stimulate their inner emotions. <br><br>

       [GOAL] <br>
       [about MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB] <br>
       • Is a space in which merge design, graphics, photography, visual art, 3D, art performance and sound. <br>
       • The instrument is the product of ingenuity, the encounter with an external world not “ wild " but “ tamed " made on a human scale and dimensioned to its needs. <br>
       • Get out of the limits of the melody and enter the world of harmony. <br>
       • From this experimentation between wild, tamed, melody and harmony comes  MOHOLE CREATIVE CLUB <br>
       <br><br>
       [ROAD TO] <br>
       [about the CO-OPERATION] <br>
       This project has started like a co-operation from Camillo Frigeni (designer, raised by typographers) scuola mohole lecturer, his students of "meta·project" course in scuola mohole,  Matteo Duci, CEO in SIPH·LAB [new communication technology company] Stefano Bonassi, innovative designer in D/DOCK [design studio based in Amsterdam] and Matteo Bergamo, construction engineer in BIODOMUS [construction  company].
       After this, SIPH•LAB, co-operating with D/DOCK and BIODOMUS, and thanks to scuola mohole that give the possibility to use the academy space, the “out of box” research D.L.S.B. Theory [Darkness, Lights, Sound, BPM] by Stefano Bonassi is turned in an experimental CREATIVE CLUB.
       <br><br>
